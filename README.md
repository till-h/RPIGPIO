# Physical Computing Workshop notes

These notes were prepared for a workshop in physical computing. The suggested workshop duration is 4 to 5 hours. In particular, three aspects are addressed.

1. Fundamental setup for using Python inside Jupyter Notebooks on a Raspberry Pi system. (Following on from experience, we strongly suggest using a RPi 3, rather than a Zero when working with Jupyter in Chromium or similar. The Pi Zero struggles to serve all the graphics required.)

2. Recapping a few Python basics, including variables and operators, user input, lists, control flow (such as `if... elif... else`) and functions.

3. Physical computing on Raspberry Pi, using the GPIO pins, and the Adafruit Stepper Motor HAT, together with different DC and stepper motors. HATs are plug-in circuit boards that allow the Pi to "talk" to a larger variety of physical devices. More details and installation instructions for the Stepper Motor HAT can be found at https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348.

4. Basic data visualisation using Matplotlib/Pylab.

We used these materials to enable a cohort of 24 post-graduate students to build various motor-driven contraptions at [Imperial College Advanced Hackspace](www.icah.org.uk).

Thanks goes to [Starignus](https://github.com/Starignus) and [JSP110](https://github.com/JSP110), on whose much more extensive [RPIGPIO](https://github.com/Starignus/RPIGPIO) course this work is heavily based.
