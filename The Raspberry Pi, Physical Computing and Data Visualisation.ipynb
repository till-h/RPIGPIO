    "Raspberry Pi is a small computer the size of a credit card that you can plug into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you would use your desktop PC or laptop. You can generate spreadsheets, do word processing, browse the internet, and play games. It also plays high-definition video.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what will make it interesting for us is its capability for use in electronics projects! The main aim of the Raspberry Pi is to teach anyone how to use programming and electronics to realise their ideas. Raspberry Pi comes with a free Linux operating system that runs from an SD card, and it is simply powered by a USB phone charger.\n",

    "We will be working with the **RPi 3 Model B** and **RPi Zero W**, which were launched in 2016 and 2017. The RPi 3 Model B is based around a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, has 1GB of RAM, while the smaller and cheaper Zero W is based on a 1 GHz single-core ARM1176JZF-S processor with 512GB RAM. Both have 802.11n Wireless and Bluetooth 4.1 included on the chip. Look at them -- all of this is included in those black chips soldered onto the boards! That's also why we call these little wonders \"System on a Chip\" -- the entire computer system resides in silicon.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above picture shows a Raspberry Pi 3. On the right-hand side, you have four **USB ports** and one **Ethernet** port. Next to the USB ports, there is a **USB/Ethernet Controller**, which translates data between the ports and the main processor, because the processor itself doesn't understand the USB or Ethernet protocol. At the top, you can find the **General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins** (40 of them to be precise). Down the bottom middle is the **CSI (Camera Serial Interface) connector**, which allows you to connect mobile-phone-style cameras directly to the Pi. Of course, you also have the option to connect a webcam via USB. At the right-hand side, you can find a **DSI (Display Serial Interface) connector** that you can use to connect an LCD screen. At the bottom, you can find the **HDMI port**, which allows you to connect the Pi straight into a monitor. Next to this port, you can see the **USB power connector** and also an **audio port**. The back side of the Pi houses a micro SD card slot for the SD card containing the operating system and user data -- just like a classical hard disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second image shows the layout of a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which is the board that most of you will work with in this tutorial.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, at the top of the board there are 40 **General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins**. The arrangement of these pins is exactly the same as on the Pi 3. This allows us to use the boards practially interchangeably. The Pi Zero W has a different (slightly less powerful) **processor**, and offers connectivity through a **mini HDMI** and a single **micro USB** port, both placed at the bottom of the board. The distinguishing feature of the Pi Zero W is its built-in Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity, which is housed in the **WLAN/Bluetooth controller**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, please be aware of the following limitations when using your Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always make sure you supply only 5 V to the RPi.\n",
    "* Unlike Arduino, RPi does not have over-voltage protection on the board (yet), so be careful when making GPIO connections.\n",
    "* Never connect more than a potential difference of 3.3V to the GPIO pins (for example, when using sensors to feed data into the Pi).\n",
    "* Never demand that any GPIO pin source or sink more than 16 mA.\n",
    "* Pins can supply only maximum 50 mA.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this workshop, if you are unsure about connecting something new to your Raspberry Pi (particularly anything feeding a voltage or a current into it), do come and ask one of us mentors first -- it might prevent your board from frying! Let us now consider what we _can_ do with those pins!\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"rpi6\"></a> General Purpose I/O Pins (GPIO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Raspberry Pi is more than just a small computer; it is a hardware prototyping tool! The RPi has **bi-directional I/O pins**, which you can use to drive LEDs, spin motors, or read button presses. Using these pins requires a bit or programming. While you can use a [variety of programming languages](http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#GPIO_Code_examples) to \"do\" GPIO, we will use a reliable, easy-to-use language throughout this hackathon: **Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  GPIO Pinout\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, the GPIO is arranged as a header of 40 electrical pins, which makes it easy to connect it with an external circuit, using jumper wires. From the first models to the latest, the header has expanded from 26 pins to 40 pins while maintaining the original pinout.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"rpi_old_new_pin.jpg\" alt=\"rpi\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) two, different numbering schemes you may encounter when referencing **Pi pin numbers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Broadcom chip-specific** pin numbers -- looking at the pins from the processor's perspective.\n",
    "2. **P1 physical** pin numbers -- looking at the pins from the user's perspective, much like house numbers along street.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either number-system, but when you are programming the pins in Python, you need to declare which scheme you are using at the very beginning of your program. We will see this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows all 40 pins on the header, including any particular function they may have, and their dual numbers. _Pin#_ refers to the P1 physical numbering, and _NAME_ to the Broadcom-specific numbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"header_pinout.jpg\" alt=\"pin\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table highlights these numbering schemes again. The **P1 physical numbering** is shaded blue, and **Broadcom chip-specific** numbers are shaded red. You can safely ignore the other columns (there are probably as many ways to count these pins as there are number systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"RPIGPIOLayoutTable.png\" alt=\"pin\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The table also shows the additional data protocols that can be accessed through some of the GPIO pins: [Serial (UART)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication), [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c), [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi), Pulse width modulation ([PWM](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation). We will actually use the I2C protocol to control an external circuit board for DC motors later.\n",

    "# Programming in Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Python as a programming language has been around since around 1985 and is actually a Dutch invention. Below is a picture of its original creator Guido van Rossum. To this date, he is very much involved in setting the overall direction for the ongoing development work of Python.\n",

    "## The Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programming language comes with some preferred tools for developing programs in. When it comes to writing computer programs in Python, the **Jupyter Notebook** is one such really useful tool.\n",
    "\n",

    "In our case, type `jupyter notebook` and press Enter. After a moment, a Chromium session opens up, which shows the **Jupyter file explorer**.\n",

You can add new cells by clicking the `insert cell below` button. Whichever cell you click on becomes the active cell, marked by the blinking cursor, and a thick vertical bar on the left.\n",
